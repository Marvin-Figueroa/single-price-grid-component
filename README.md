# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is my solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma sketch, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
